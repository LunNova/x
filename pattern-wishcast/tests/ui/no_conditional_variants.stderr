error: No conditional variants found for enum `Value`. All variants are included in all pattern types, making them identical. Either: 1) Add variants that are excluded from some pattern types, 2) Use a single type alias instead of multiple identical ones, or 3) Remove `is <P: PatternFields>` if you don't need strictness patterns.
